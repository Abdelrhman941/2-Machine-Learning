# 🛠️ Data Preprocessing - Essential Step in Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
Data preprocessing is the first and most crucial step in any **Machine Learning (ML) pipeline**. It involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data to improve model accuracy and efficiency. This repository contains a structured approach to preprocessing, ensuring that your data is well-prepared for training ML models.

This repository follows a structured folder system, where each folder represents a step in the **ML workflow**. By following these folders in order, you can build a solid foundation for your models.

## 🔍 Steps in Data Preprocessing

### 1️⃣ Handling Missing Values
**Why?** Missing data can lead to biased models or errors in prediction.

**Methods:**
- **Remove missing values** (if they are few and non-critical).
- **Impute missing values** using strategies like:
  - Mean/Median for numerical data.
  - Most frequent value for categorical data.
  - Advanced techniques like KNN imputation.

### 2️⃣ Handling Outliers
**Why?** Outliers can distort model predictions and lead to inaccurate results.

**Methods:**
- **Boxplots** to detect extreme values.
- **Z-score method** to identify data points that are too far from the mean.
- **IQR method** (Interquartile Range) to remove extreme values.

### 3️⃣ Splitting Data
**Why?** To evaluate model performance fairly.

**Method:**
- **Train-Test Split** (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
- **Cross-validation** (e.g., k-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation).

### 4️⃣ Encoding Categorical Data
**Why?** Machine learning models work with numerical values, not categorical labels.

**Methods:**
- **Label Encoding** (for ordinal categories: small, medium, large → 0,1,2).
- **One-Hot Encoding** (for nominal categories like colors or cities).

### 5️⃣ Feature Selection
**Why?** Reducing the number of input variables can improve model performance and speed.

**Methods:**
- **Correlation Matrix** to identify redundant features.
- **Feature Importance (using models like Random Forests or Lasso Regression).**
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** for dimensionality reduction.

### 6️⃣ Feature Scaling
**Why?** Features with large differences in scale can dominate models and affect learning.

**Methods:**
- **Min-Max Scaling** (Normalizing values between 0 and 1).
- **Standardization** (Transforming to zero mean and unit variance).

## 🎯 Next Steps After Preprocessing
Once data preprocessing is complete, the next steps in the ML pipeline include:
1. **Feature Engineering** - Creating new features from existing ones.
2. **Model Selection** - Choosing the right ML algorithm.
3. **Model Training & Evaluation** - Training the model and assessing performance.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning** - Optimizing the model for better results.
